Place the required brand font files you added in this folder.

Recommended filenames (used by default in `app/globals.css`):

- `sephir.otf` or `sephir.ttf`
- `dahlianti-angelina.otf` or `dahlianti-angelina.ttf`

If your font filenames differ, update the `src` urls in `app/globals.css` accordingly (search for `@font-face`).

Prefer `woff2` for best compression when available, but `.otf`/`.ttf` are supported as you added.
